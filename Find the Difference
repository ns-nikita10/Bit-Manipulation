/*
  You are given two strings s and t.
  String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
  Return the letter that was added to t.
  
  Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
  Output: "e"
  Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
  
  Input: s = "", t = "y"
  Output: "y"
